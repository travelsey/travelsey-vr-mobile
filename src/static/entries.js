    subtitle:
      "Venice is definitely one-of-a-kind. Where else would you find a city on the water? Its location gives it a unique and a bit mysterious character.

The city centre makes you feel like a time traveller travelling back in time to the époque of Casanova - probably the very best-known citizen of Venice. If you’re lucky enough to visit the city during the carnivals, you will be up for a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And don’t forget to stop by in one of the many restaurants to taste the exquisite local cuisine.",
